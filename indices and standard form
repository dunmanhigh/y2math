Indices / standard form



Change everything to index form first 
Change to same base > eg 2, 8=(2)3 : compare power + eg. (14)4n / (2)2n = (2x7)4n / (2)2n => expand/simplify 
Change to same power: compare base (solving equations with unknown base or power) 1. Simplify by factorising such that x is by itself/no coefficient 
Convert negative index form to positive
=> (fraction) negative power : switch fraction around(numerator vs denominator)

=> bring numerator of a fraction down to change its power from positive to negative

(Vice versa)
