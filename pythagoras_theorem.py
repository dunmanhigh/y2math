The One day, Stellirana, a painter of Thepainterco company, went to paint a wall. 
To make sure she is safe, her ladder has to be placed 10 cm away from the wall.
If her ladder is 16 cm long, how long is the distance from the tip of ladder on the wall and the ground?

Using Pythagoras' Theorem,
let x be the distance needed to be found.
(16)^2=(10)^2+ (x)^2
x=12.90cm
