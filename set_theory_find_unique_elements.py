# Find the unique elements in arr

arr = [1, 3, 9, 0, 2, 5, 18, 3, 9, 2]

appeared = {}

for i in range (len(arr)):
    # Do something here
    '''
    Hint:
    Use a dictionary to store the counts of the elements
    Example: appeared[9] = 2
    '''

for i in appeared:
    # Do something here
    '''
    Hint:
    How do you check if something is unique?.
    What will appeared[i] equals to?
